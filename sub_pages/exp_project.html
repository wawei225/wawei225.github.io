                <p>  
                    This simulation aims to demonstrate the A/B testing process. Therefore, the data is simulated, and the website is limited to two main pages for simplicity. The methodology for data simulation and the conceptual structure of the website will be explained in detail in next sections. This project simulates a typical A/B testing process, focusing on the evaluation of a redesigned trending section on an e-commerce platform’s homepage. The primary objective is to 
                    <strong>
                    determine whether the new design improves user engagement and increases the click-through rate (CTR) of the trending section.
                    </strong> 
                </p>

                <h1 class = "section-title-report">Problem Statement and Hypothesis</h1>
                <p>  
                    We assume there are two main pages: the homepage and the item page. Each page consists of two sections: the discovery and trending sections for the homepage, and the description and review sections for the item page. The new UI design is for the trending section on the homepage. The trending section highlights the most-ordered items on the platform. However, empirical data indicates that its conversion rate is below the overall homepage average, suggesting that the current design does not effectively capture user interest. The product team hypothesizes that a redesigned layout will enhance visual appeal and usability, leading to a higher click-through rate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Hypothesis</strong>:The redesigned trending section will result in a statistically significant increase in CTR compared to the existing design, thereby improving user engagement and potentially driving higher conversions.
                </p>

               <h1 class = "section-title-report">Scope of the experiment</h1>
                <p>To simplify the scope of this A/B test, the website will be structured into two main pages and their key sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Homepage</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Discovery Section:</strong> General recommendations based on user preferences. This section displays multiple different items and users can click on any of them, which will direct them to the item page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trending Section:</strong> Items with the highest order volume on the platform, and users can click on any of them, which will direct them to the item page.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Item Page</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Description Section:</strong> Product details and specifications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review Section:</strong> User-generated reviews and ratings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class = "section-title-report">Simulated data</h1>
                <p>  
                    To conduct this simulation, historical and experimental data were synthetically generated using ChatGPT. The dataset was designed to replicate real-world user interactions and engagement patterns, ensuring the validity of the simulated A/B test.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Historical Data Generation</strong> 
                    <br>
                    ChatGPT was used to create a dataset that represents prior user behavior on the platform for the two pages (Home and Item). This dataset serves as a baseline for conversion rate analysis before introducing experimental changes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Experiment Data Generation</strong> 
                    <br>
                    Simulated user interactions were generated for both:
                    <li><strong>Control Group (existing UI design)</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Variant Group (redesigned UI design)</strong>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    These interactions track user engagement across devices and sections, enabling accurate measurement of the impact of the redesigned UI on conversion rates.

                <h1 class = "section-title-report">Experiment Metrics</h1>

                    <p>
                        When determining the success metric for an A/B test, a data scientist collaborates with the product manager to align measurement with business objectives. 
                        In our experiment, we aim to evaluate changes in the <strong>trending section’s click-through rate (CTR)</strong> to measure its impact on user engagement. 
                        Given that repeated exposures may lead to <strong>diminishing returns</strong>, we select <strong>User-Level CTR</strong>—the proportion of users who click at least once—as the primary metric. 
                        This ensures we capture whether the feature effectively drives initial engagement, rather than penalizing it for natural drop-offs in repeated visits.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The User-Level CTR is calculated as:</strong></p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        \[
                        \text{User-Level CTR} = \frac{\text{Number of users who clicked at least once}}{\text{Total number of users exposed to the trending section}}
                        \]
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To validate randomization, we check for <strong>Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)</strong> and establish a <strong>baseline User-Level CTR</strong> from historical data. 
                        This metric directly ties to our hypothesis: if the new design improves engagement, we should observe a statistically significant increase in 
                        <strong>User-Level CTR</strong> without compromising traffic distribution fairness.
                    </p>
